I have used Node-JS for server, Angular-JS for frontend and MongoDB for Datastore

Q1) What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?

ANS. I chose MongoDB (NOSQL)because of its NOSQL nature. MongoDB stores data in BSON but represents and outputs in JSON, which can be handled easily with Node-JS or Rails. The Malbs functionality simplified the data store for me as I dint have to create database in Heroku which might have been more complex with compared to this.

Q2)What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

ANS. Getting my data on to the mlabs was easy because of the user-friendliness of the whole system and its simplicity. The front end part was relatively easy.

Q3)What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

ANS. I found that getting data to the client was difficult for me and making 100 AJAX requests was also little difficult. Animation took some but with help of community I could do it. 

Q4)If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?

ANS. The combination of Node-JS Angular and MongoDB is quite prevelent in idustry already. Node's non-opinionated nature is really helpful when understanding concepts and its multithreading capacity is really good and can be compared to Rails in terms of scalability. MongoDb is also very popular and vastly used by major indutry giants. Although my biggest concern would be that whether my application can or cannot handle the sudden increase in requests and whether MongoDB is one stop shop for all types of data.
